# we can directly assign value to a variable in python
# like other programming languages like C, C++,  first initialise the data
#  type of variable . In python we do not need to declare the variable and then assign value to it

# In Python, there is no need of explicit declaration  in variables as compare to using some other programming
# languages. You can start using the variable right away.

# initialising variable directly
a = 5
 
# printing value of a
print ("The value of a is: " + str(a))

b = 10
print(b)

print(a+b)
